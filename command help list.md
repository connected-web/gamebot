# Gamebot

Gamebot allows people to play board games through Slack

## Getting Started

Once you are in the Slack team, join the channel that corresponds with the game you wish to play. To date, there are two game channels, _resistance_ and _codenames_. Below are descriptions of the games and the commands required to play them.


## Gamebot Commands
These commands are used regardless of the game being played, or to interact with a bot in the non-game channels. Game commands must be played in the relevant game's channel.

### Game Commands 

_join game_ - adds you to the list of players for that game.

_leave game_ - removes you from the list of current players for that game.

_start game_ - starts the game and assigns players their roles/teams.

_reset game_ - resets the current game and keeps all players in the player list.

_stop game_ - stops the current game and removes all players from the player list.

## Resistance Commands
These commands are used for playing Resistance in addition to the Gamebot commands.
